Titre : Simulation models in quantitative geography: towards integrated approaches

Abstract : This presentation will give a broad overview of recent progresses in the application of simulation models to theoretical and quantitative geography problems. More particularly, it will focus on contributions linked to the construction of Pumain’s Evolutive Urban Theory, which has integrated theoretical knowledge with empirical stylized facts and new methods to explore simulation models. In an incremental manner, each component is crucial to provide evidence-based approaches to complex social systems. The development of new exploration and calibration methods in the OpenMOLE platform which provides transparent access to high performance computing, has allowed a qualitative shift in knowledge extracted from simulation models. These approaches will be illustrated by the particular case of co-evolution models between transportation networks and territories. Examples of such models are developed at the metropolitan and regional scale, and we show in particular how these can inform urban morphogenesis processes and the existence of different co-evolution regimes.

Bio : Juste Raimbault holds a PhD from University Paris 7, under the supervision of Arnaud Banos (Géographie-cités) and Florent Le Nechet (LVMT), studying modeling the co-evolution of transportation networks and territories. With an interdisciplinary background in Complex Systems, his work is situated at the interface of Geography and Computer Science. He is currently both a Research Fellow at CASA, UCL, where he studies the coupling of microsimulation models with land-use transport interaction models, and a Post-doctoral researcher at ISC-PIF where he develops model exploration and calibration methods and contributes to the development of the OpenMOLE platform.
