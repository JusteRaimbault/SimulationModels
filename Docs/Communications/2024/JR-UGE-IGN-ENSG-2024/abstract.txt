A scientometric analysis of linkages between urban digital twins and urban simulation models

Following the trend of smart cities, urban systems have been under an extensive focus for the development of urban digital twins, which are particularly relevant given their complex nature, the abundance of real-time data within cities, and the difficulty of decision-making to manage and design cities over several time scales. In that context, urban simulation models, which have been largely studied for several decades, should be at the core of such approaches, following the standard definition of a twin which mirrors the processes of the twinned system, and for these to have any interest for decision-making. We propose in this contribution a scientometric analysis of effective linkages between these two streams of literature, namely urban digital twins and urban simulation models. We construct a large citation network using open bibliographic data collection tools, and find that despite the fact that many twins use simulation, connections between the fields remain relatively low. This may reflect the fact that existing twins operate mainly at a short time scale, whereas urban simulation deals with slower dynamics. This highlights the need for a higher interoperability and integration between these approaches.
