The OpenMOLE platform is a free and open source software, developped for and by researchers for more than 10 years at the Complex Systems Institute in Paris. The main goal of the platform is to help researchers from any discipline interested in simulation models to explore and validate their models. It is based on three complementary axis: (i) model embedding for any programming language; (ii) transparent access to high performance computing infrastructures; and (iii) state-of-the-art methods in sensitivity analysis, design of experiments, exporation and validation (see https://openmole.org/). A high level workflow language based on scala facilitates model integration and numerical experiments. The platform can be run as a server on any commputer but also be set as a web service to easily monitor heavy computational experiments.
This platform and associated model validation techniques and practices have value for the Artificial Life community, since simulation models are a key components of ALife research. The aim of this tutoria
l is to provide a first hands-on and basic knowledge of how to set up numerical experiments, starting with simple model embedding and standard design of experiments for parameter space exploration. It wil
l then illustrate more advanced techniques, including model calibration using a multi-objective genetic algorithm and diversity search applied to model phase space. Finally, new methods for spatial sensit
ivity analysis will be briefly presented and illustrated.
Depending on the number of participants and available time, some specific discussions on how to integrate participants' models into the platform, and what would be the appropriate methods for a given ques
tion, could be discussed.
