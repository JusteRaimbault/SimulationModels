\section{Project}


\subsection{Research axis}

This project has the general goal of improving the way to extract knowledge from spatial simulation models. More precisely, it is structured around three complementary axis that tackle some of the open issues given above. This axis are, in an arbitrary order :
\begin{itemize}
\item the development of spatial synthetic data generation methods \cite{raimbault2016generation}, and of associated sensitivity analysis protocols and methods \cite{cottineau2017initial};
\item the development and benchmarking of heuristics for model exploration;
\item the investigation of how to consider model structure in the evaluation of simulation models, or how to avoid overfitting in multi-modeling practices \cite{raimbault2017indirect}.
\end{itemize}

The insertion within the general dynamic of the OpenMole project, and elements of answer to the overall problematic, arise more from the \emph{interaction} between each research axis
