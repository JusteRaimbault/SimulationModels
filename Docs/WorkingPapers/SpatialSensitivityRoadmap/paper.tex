\section{Introduction}







\section{Roadmap}


\subsection{General view}

Two global axis can be formulated:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The generation of synthetic spatial data
	\item The import and manipulation of real spatial data 
\end{enumerate}

A longer term goal is a stronger link between these two.


\subsection{Generation of synthetic spatial data}


\subsubsection{Raster data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Single layer synthetic grids
	\item Multi-layer synthetic grids
	\item Multi-layer with specified correlation structure
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vector data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Transportation networks
	\item Spatialized `classic` network generation models
	\item Correlated layers	
	\item Correlated network and raster 
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Architecture}

\textit{Question : to what point methods are within oml plugin or in an external library ?}




\section{Implementation}


\subsection{Example of a workflow}

We illustrate spatial sensitivity analysis by coupling a spatial generator embedded into OpenMOLE as a \texttt{Sampling} with a toy Luti model, using new features of the \texttt{NetLogoTask}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate realistic correlated spatial grids with an exponential mixture using a \texttt{SpatialSampling}
	\item Plug this into a NetLogoTask (recursive arrays inputs) for a toy Luti model
	\item Get successive system states (recursive array outputs)
\end{itemize}


\section*{Application}

First application : comparison of the scala implementation and the netlogo implementation of the Luti part of the Lutecia model (only spatial setup is random).
