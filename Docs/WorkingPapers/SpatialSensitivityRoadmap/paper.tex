\section{Introduction}


\cite{lilburne2009sensitivity} study how standard sensitivity analysis methods can be applied to spatial models, and show that Sobol sensitivity index is the most suited for such models. \cite{saint2010comparison} benchmark three sensitivity analysis techniques and also concludes that Sobol is better in reflecting changes in model behavior.

\cite{cottineau2017initial} suggest the use of synthetic data generation to test the sensitivity of simple agent-based models to their spatial initial configuration.

\cite{obled1994sensitivity} combine observational data with a baseline model to understand to sensitivity of hydrographs to the spatial distribution of rainfall.


\cite{Thomasetal2017} show that city boundary selection can have a significant impact on model behavior for Luti models.


In environmental science, multi-criteria decision analysis based on GIS has been tested for the sensitivity to weight \cite{chen2010spatial}.

\section{Roadmap}


\subsection{General view}

Two global axis can be formulated:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The generation of synthetic spatial data
	\item The import and manipulation of real spatial data 
\end{enumerate}

A longer term goal is a stronger link between these two. The different axis belong to different knowledge domains \cite{raimbault2017applied} and their relations foster integrative approaches.



\subsection{Generation of synthetic spatial data}


\subsubsection{Raster data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Single layer synthetic grids ; several methods implemented :
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Kernel mixtures \cite{anas1998urban}
			\item Reaction-diffusion model generating population distributions \cite{raimbault2018calibration}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Multi-layer synthetic grids
	\item Multi-layer with specified correlation structure
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vector data}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Transportation networks
	\item Spatialized `classic` network generation models
	\item Correlated layers	
	\item Correlated network and raster 
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Perturbation of real data}

\section{Implementation}


\subsection{Architecture}

\textit{Question : to what point methods are within oml plugin or in an external library ?}


\subsection{Example of a workflow}

We illustrate spatial sensitivity analysis by coupling a spatial generator embedded into OpenMOLE as a \texttt{Sampling} with a toy Luti model, using new features of the \texttt{NetLogoTask}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate realistic correlated spatial grids with an exponential mixture using a \texttt{SpatialSampling}
	\item Plug this into a NetLogoTask (recursive arrays inputs) for a toy Luti model
	\item Get successive system states (recursive array outputs)
\end{itemize}


\section*{Application}

First application : comparison of the scala implementation and the netlogo implementation of the Luti part of the Lutecia model (only spatial setup is random).
