\begin{abstract}
We illustrate spatial sensitivity analysis by coupling a spatial generator embedded into OpenMOLE as a \texttt{Sampling} with a toy Luti model, using new features of the \texttt{NetLogoTask}
\end{abstract}


\section*{Workflow}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate realistic correlated spatial grids with an exponential mixture using a \texttt{SpatialSampling}
	\item Plug this into a NetLogoTask (recursive arrays inputs) for a toy Luti model
	\item Get successive system states (recursive array outputs)
\end{itemize}


\section*{Application}

First application : comparison of the scala implementation and the netlogo implementation (only spatial setup is random).
