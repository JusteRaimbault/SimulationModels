# Positioning OpenMOLE in its scientific environment

## Context

Objective : situate OpenMOLE regarding the different related scientific communities
- which visibility ?
- which patterns of relation with the different domains ?
- enhance reflexivity for a better positioning strategy

## Methods and Data

### General workflow

keywords/articles -> citation networks -> semantic networks -> scientific communities

### Methods

- *Citing OML* OpenMOLE papers as initial corpus (file `data/corpus.csv`) => backward citation network at depth 3
- *Keywords positioning*
    - Brainstorming : keywords for current positioning (file `data/`) ; keywords for future positioning (file `data/`) ; keywords for risks (file `data/`)
    - From positioning keywords : requests list (file `data`), raw corpuses from keyword requests (keep 50 references for each request), with raw requests and adding `openmole` for each -> files
    - manual screening of corpuses, removing of duplicates -> basis corpuses
    - construction of citation networks from these basis corpuses


## Results

*WIP*
